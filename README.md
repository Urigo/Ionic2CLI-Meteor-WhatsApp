Ionic2-Meteor-Messenger
-----------------------

`ionic2-meteor-messenger` is a step-by-step tutorial that will guide you on how to create a messenger app using:

- [ionic2](ionicframework.com/docs/v2)
- [meteor](meteor.com)
- [angular2](angular.io)
- [angular2-meteor](angular-meteor.com/angular2)
- [webpack](webpack.com)

The messenger app was created using `ionic`'s CLI. The same result could be achieved using `meteor`'s CLI, but I also wanted to go through the bundling process using `webpack`, therefore `meteor`'s build system would have prevented me from doing so. A `meteor` CLI version of this tutorial might be implemented in the future.

A step-by-step version of this app exists in the [step-by-step branch](github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/step-by-step), and it's tutorial is written in the [tutorial dir](github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/master/tutorial) of this repository. A blog post with a very detailed explenasion about each step is available at [angular-meteor's official website](angular-meteor.com/tutorials/whatsapp2/ionic/setup), and a video tutorial series can be found on [Youtube](youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEFEil62pk3dRXiC6sI--V1aVDkOW0Ls).
