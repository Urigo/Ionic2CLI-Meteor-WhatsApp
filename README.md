Facing your next mobile app project, you want to choose the best solutions to start fast while also solutions that will stay relevant when your project grows and scales.

The two companies that took the concept of creating a platform with a complete set of tools for your development needs and not just another Framework to the furthest are Meteor and Ionic.

**Ionic** - Ionic has become one of the most popular solutions to develop hybrid mobile apps fast across different platform.

The Ionic platform includes solutions for prototyping, build, testing, deploying apps, a market of starter apps, plugins and themes, CLI integration and push notifications service. (Further writing by an Ionic person)

**Meteor** - But your app needs a full stack solution.

Meteor has become the only open source Javascript platform that supply the complete set of solutions you need to create a real time mobile connected apps.

The Meteor platform is reliable, fast and easy to develop and deploy and it will also handle all the complexities of your app when it grows and scales with time.

### So which one should you choose?

Your best option is to use them both!

With angular-meteor, Meteor became the best backend for Angular and Ionic apps.

Both companies made the steps needed to support each other:

- [Meteor now has official support for Angular with it's 3rd party libraries!](http://info.meteor.com/blog/official-angular-support-with-angular-meteor-1.0.0?__hstc=219992390.d5a12b08bbf681831d288088f2c1b55f.1476117688291.1482430169317.1482433129287.88&__hssc=219992390.2.1482433129287&__hsfp=2355228760)
- [Ionic added official support for Meteor's packaging system](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/pull/3133)

So now you we can use the strengthnesses of each of those platform combined the create the ultimate stack for your mobile apps.

In this post, we will create a full WhatsApp clone, using Angular and the Ionic Framework, using Meteor's realtime collections for the chat and Meteor's simple Authentication packages for SMS based authentication.

Both platform has their own CLI and build process solutions.

You can choose the CLI and build process that you prefer.

So I've decided to create to two versions of that blog post, one, on Ionic's blog, using the Ionic CLI and one, on Meteor's blog, using the Meteor CLI and build process.
